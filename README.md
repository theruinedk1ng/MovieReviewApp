# Movie Review App

Movie review app created in Java using Swing and AWT. The app allows the user to indroduce, edit and delte movies along with information such as film director, actors, release date and a grade as well as searching a movie. It also allows the user to add several reviews and delete them if wanted. This was a project for college. In order for the code to run it needs two .txt files, movies.txt and reviews.txt, which save the data introduced and displays it in the GUI based on the content of the files.
